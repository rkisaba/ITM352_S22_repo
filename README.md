First repository (1/10/22)
I am 19 year old Sophomore at UH Manoa studying Finance, MIS, and Economics. I currently work in the Admissions Office as an Admissions Assistant, but in the little free time that I do have I enjoy a wide variety of things. This includes playing video games, going fishing/diving, aquascaping, and DIY-ing.
